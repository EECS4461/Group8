Agent-based modeling of coordinated bot activities and AI moderation dynamics on Xiaohongshu's e-commerce platform.

Deliverable Documents are in `\docs`, while adapted measa modeling in `mesa-model`.

## Features

- üïµÔ∏è **Adversarial Bots**: Simulate keyword-targeted promotional campaigns
- üõ°Ô∏è **Platform AI**: Dynamic detection with DBSCAN clustering
- üòÄ **User Behavior**: Emotion contagion model with trust decay
- üìä **Visualization**: Real-time metrics dashboard

### Key Features  
- Multi-agent system modeling ad bots, shill bots, users, and platform AI  
- Dynamic detection-evasion mechanisms using reinforcement learning  
- Emotion contagion model for user trust decay
